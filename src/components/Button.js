// If you need similar small helps, just hmu. I'll try to help you so that you can focus on major development.
// This is my first time doing this type of contributing (first time ever PR), so yep will gladly help. I also know MERN and MEAN (can help those too if you too tired to implement lol)(Check my GitHub Side-Projects). Thank you!

// Also removed some emptyspaces to make the code look more clean (CTRL S with Prettier)
